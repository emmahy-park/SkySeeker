### Story
As the player, you start outside your house in the Abyss, a large city steeped in darkness. You will fight your way through different levels to try and reach the top so you can escape from the Abyss. You will progress through different rooms and fight many enemies. After defeating all enemies in a room, you may choose one of the offered items that will augment your combat abilities before proceeding to the next room of your choice. Throughout your journey, you will gain a multitude of items that will help you face the boss enemy that blocks your way to your goal. And if you die, well, thereâ€™s always another person yearning to leave the abyss.
